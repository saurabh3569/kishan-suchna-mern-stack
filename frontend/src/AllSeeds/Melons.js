      <h3>Melons</h3>
      <p>Growing melons in the home garden is so rewardingâ€”and homegrown melons are a sweet, summertime treat. Watermelon and cantaloupe are some of the favorite melons for home gardeners. While large melons are quite popular, more and more gardeners are growing smaller, personalized-sized melons. Melons grow best in full sun and in well-drained soil rich in organic matter. Melon seed can be started indoors about 4-6 weeks before the last spring frost date or can be directly sown into raised planting hills in the garden. Sow melon seed in the garden about a week before the last spring frost date for your area. Make sure you leave plenty of space for the melon vines, as they will spread.</p>
