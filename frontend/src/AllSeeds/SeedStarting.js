      <h3>Seed Starting</h3>
	  <p>Get a jump-start on the gardening season by starting vegetable, herb and flower seeds indoors. Many gardeners sow tomato, pepper and other seeds indoors about 4-8 weeks before the last spring frost date. Once the weather and soil warms, they transplant the seedlings to the garden. Starting seeds indoors is more economical than buying potted plantsâ€”and you often have a greater selection of seed choices than plant choices. Before starting seeds indoors, make sure you have all the seed-starting supplies you need, such as peat pellets and peat pots as well as Hotkaps, a great product for promoting better germination and growth.</p>
